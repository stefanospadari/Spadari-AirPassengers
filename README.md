# Air Passengers Time Series Analysis

This repository has been developed as part of the project work for the Data Mining / Machine Learning M course. It provides a comprehensive study on time series forecasting, focusing on classical and modern deep learning approaches.

The main goal of this project is to explore and compare different methodologies for handling and predicting time-dependent data. Specifically, the notebook guides the user through the implementation and evaluation of:

- ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks

## Dataset
The analysis is performed on the Air Passengers dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset contains the monthly totals of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960.
